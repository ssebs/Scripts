MergePDF
===============================
The purpose of this is to combine multiple
PDF files together. 

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1) Drag your pdf's into the "MergePDF" folder.

2) Then, double click the icon of the gears that says "MergePDF"

3) Once done, it will output a file called "__Merged.pdf"


This is the merged file. It combined all of the files that you
dragged in by alphabetical order from the name of the file.

i.e. file1.pdf will go before file2.pdf

The old pdf files will be put inside a folder with the date located in the "MergePDF" folder. 

i.e. MergePDF/Old/12-10-2016_11
			(the 11 is the hour of the day)
